# Sparta_Global_Cucumber_Ecommerce_Testing

This was a project to combine previous work (on testing an example ecommerce site using capybara) into using Cucumber and Gherkin. The index viewable on github pages is an example report produced from running a test. It tests one scenario of making a purchase on the site, from visiting the site for order confirmation.
